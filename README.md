# ATtiny85-Continuity-Tester

The lack of good quality Continuity Testers is shocking.  Even some of the more expensives ones are terrible. <br />
False Alarms and the potential of damaging sensitive equipment have to be looked at as well. <br />

I found this ATtiny Continuity Tester schematic from https://github.com/technoblogy/continuity-tester  <br /> 
Having an easy to assembly kit for DIYers was also considered in the creation of this PCB. <br />

ATtiny85 Program Code can be found here:  http://www.technoblogy.com/list?1ZNS <br />

It is set to go into sleep mode after 1 minute to save battery power. <br />
in Sleep Mode, the LED will be powered off and will wake again when the leads touch. <br /> 
A power switch was also included so that it can be stored for longer periods of time. <br />

Not wanting to replace batteries often, I included a dual 18650 holder that has both batteries in parallel. <br />
The 18650 Batteries will literally self-discharge before being used up by this circuit.  <br />

Project is completely open source with Kicad files to be provided.  This can be modified to your hears desire. <br />

Here is a blown up picture of this board with things removed to make it easier to see what parts go where. <br />
